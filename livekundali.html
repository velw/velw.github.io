<!--
Need:
astrolib.js

also graha.js 
with classes for planets (use inheritance for special planets like the moon with extra calcS?)

and also a class to hold the zodiac information, which also updates

also - colour object
maybe make background of window black? (to get rid of light gray line along bottom?)

 -- only recalculate planetary positions every x miliseconds (depending on speed of planet - use a date object to compare against last calculation time)
    because planets don't move as often as animation
